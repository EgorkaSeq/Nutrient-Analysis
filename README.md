This project explores the nutritional composition of 7,058 food products through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover trends in calories, macronutrients (protein, fats, carbs), vitamins, and minerals, providing insights for diet planning, health tracking, and potential machine learning applications.

✔ Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
✔ Descriptive Analysis – Summarize key nutritional metrics (calories, protein, fats, etc.).
✔ Visualization – Use histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to reveal nutrient patterns.
✔ Feature Engineering – Identify key features for predictive modeling (e.g., sugar vs. fat content).
✔ Insights & Recommendations – Highlight findings for dietary planning and health awareness.

Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data manipulation & calculations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots)

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis & documentation
